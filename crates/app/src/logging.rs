//! The `tracing` sink.
//!
//! # Why this is new
//!
//! The workspace has ~230 `tracing::` call sites and, until this
//! module, no subscriber. `tracing` records nothing without one, so
//! every `warn!` and `error!` in the codebase was a no-op that went
//! nowhere — including the ones written specifically so a failure
//! would be observable rather than silent. DESIGN.md §5.5 has always
//! specified this behaviour ("on when `--verbose` or `CODEPP_LOG=info`
//! is set"); it had simply never been implemented.
//!
//! # Cost when off
//!
//! No subscriber is installed unless asked for, which is what DESIGN.md
//! §5.5 means by "zero cost" in release: with no global subscriber,
//! each call site's `enabled()` check is an atomic load of a null
//! dispatcher and returns immediately, so no formatting, allocation,
//! or I/O happens. Installing one costs the filter parse plus a writer,
//! which is why it stays behind a flag rather than being on by default
//! — DESIGN.md §8 budgets 80 ms to first frame.
